# Portfolio-Website-V1

This was created in the fall of 2021, and is considered one of many versions before the final version of my portfolio website. I decided to start this project after reviewing the basics of HTML and CSS in my AP Computer Science Principles course, which gave me a starting point for programming this.

More versions to come soon!
